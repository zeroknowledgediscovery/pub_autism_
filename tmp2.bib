  abstract	= {Universal screening is recommended to reduce the age of
		  diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However,
		  there are insufficient data on children who screen negative
		  and no study of outcomes from truly universal screening.
		  With this study, we filled these gaps by examining the
		  accuracy of universal screening with systematic follow-up
		  through 4 to 8 years.\\ Universal, primary care-based
		  screening was conducted using the Modified Checklist for
		  Autism in Toddlers with Follow-Up (M-CHAT/F) and supported
		  by electronic administration and integration into
		  electronic health records. All children with a well-child
		  visit (1) between 16 and 26 months, (2) at a Children's
		  Hospital of Philadelphia site after universal electronic
		  screening was initiated, and (3) between January 2011 and
		  July 2015 were included (N = 25 999).\\ Nearly universal
		  screening was achieved (91\%), and ASD prevalence was
		  2.2\%. Overall, the M-CHAT/F's sensitivity was 38.8\%, and
		  its positive predictive value (PPV) was 14.6\%. Sensitivity
		  was higher in older toddlers and with repeated screenings,
		  whereas PPV was lower in girls. Finally, the M-CHAT/F's
		  specificity and PPV were lower in children of color and
		  those from lower-income households.\\ Universal screening
		  in primary care is possible when supported by electronic
		  administration. In this "real-world" cohort that was
		  systematically followed, the M-CHAT/F was less accurate in
		  detecting ASD than in previous studies. Disparities in
		  screening rates and accuracy were evident in traditionally
		  underrepresented groups. Future research should focus on
		  the development of new methods that detect a greater
		  proportion of children with ASD and reduce disparities in
		  the screening process.}
