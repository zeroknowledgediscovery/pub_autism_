In the current version we have added new references to autism
screening and diagnosis tools that use videoclips of toddler behavior, and differentiated our contribution. We have also cited work on metabolomics that is reported to have some diagnostic applications. We have also addressed concerns regarding coding errors in ICD data, and clarified that our tool may be operated as a standalone screening test, or in conjunction with existing tools such as the M-CHAT/F. Our approach which relies on co-morbidity patterns, uses orthogonal information to questionnaire based tools such as the M-CHAT/F, and hence we can boost our standalone performance by combining the two test. While in the standalone mode we already have performance superior to M-CHAT/F, the combined operation vastly improves performance, reaching twice the PPV currently achieved in screening or boosting sensitivity to 60-70% depending on population prevalence, while keeping specificity > 95%.
