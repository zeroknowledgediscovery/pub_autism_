     abstract = {This paper treats the discounted cost, optimal control problem for Markov processes with incomplete state information. The optimization approach for these partially observable Markov processes is a generalization of the well-known policy iteration technique for finding optimal stationary policies for completely observable Markov processes. The state space for the problem is the space of state occupancy probability distributions (the unit simplex). The development of the algorithm introduces several new ideas, including the class of finitely transient policies, which are shown to possess piecewise linear cost functions. The paper develops easily implemented approximations to stationary policies based on these finitely transient policies and shows that the concave hull of an approximation can be included in the well-known Howard policy improvement algorithm with subsequent convergence. The paper closes with a detailed example illustrating the application of the algorithm to the two-state partially observable Markov process.},

abstract={Learning a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a training set of labeled strings is a hard task that has been much studied within the machine learning community. It is equivalent to learning a regular language by example and has applications in language modeling. In this paper, we describe a novel evolutionary method for learning DFA that evolves only the transition matrix and uses a simple deterministic procedure to optimally assign state labels. We compare its performance with the evidence driven state merging (EDSM) algorithm, one of the most powerful known DFA learning algorithms. We present results on random DFA induction problems of varying target size and training set density. We also study the effects of noisy training data on the evolutionary approach and on EDSM. On noise-free data, we find that our evolutionary method outperforms EDSM on small sparse data sets. In the case of noisy training data, we find that our evolutionary method consistently outperforms EDSM, as well as other significant methods submitted to two recent competitions.},

abstract={Computers and brains are modeled by finite and probabilistic automata, respectively. Probabilistic automata are known to be strictly more powerful than finite automata. The observation that the environment affects behavior of both computer and brain is made. Automata are then modeled in an environment. Theorem 1 shows that useful environmental models are those which are infinite sets. A probabilistic structure is placed on the environment set. Theorem 2 compares the behavior of finite (deterministic) and probabilistic automata in random environments. Several interpretations of Theorem 2 are discussed which offer some insight into some mathematical limits of machine intelligence.},

abstract={Relaxation labeling processes are a class of mechanisms that solve the problem of assigning labels to objects in a manner that is consistent with respect to some domain-specific constraints. We reformulate this using the model of a team of learning automata interacting with an environment or a high-level critic that gives noisy responses as to the consistency of a tentative labeling selected by the automata. This results in an iterative linear algorithm that is itself probabilistic. Using an explicit definition of consistency we give a complete analysis of this probabilistic relaxation process using weak convergence results for stochastic algorithms. Our model can accommodate a range of uncertainties in the compatibility functions. We prove a local convergence result and show that the point of convergence depends both on the initial labeling and the constraints. The algorithm is implementable in a highly parallel fashion.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider probabilistic context-free grammars, a class of generative devices that has been successfully exploited in several applications of syntactic pattern matching, especially in statistical natural language parsing. We investigate the problem of training probabilistic context-free grammars on the basis of distributions defined over an infinite set of trees or an infinite set of sentences by minimizing the cross-entropy. This problem has applications in cases of context-free approximation of distributions generated by more expressive statistical models. We show several interesting theoretical properties of probabilistic context-free grammars that are estimated in this way, including the previously unknown equivalence between the grammar cross-entropy with the input distribution and the so-called derivational entropy of the grammar itself. We discuss important consequences of these results involving the standard application of the maximum-likelihood estimator on finite tree and sentence samples, as well as other finite-state models such as hidden Markov models and probabilistic finite automata.},

abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in", visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.}

    abstract = {{Within its host cell, a complex coupling of transcription, translation, genome replication, assembly, and virus release processes determines the growth rate of a virus. Mathematical models that account for these processes can provide insights into the understanding as to how the overall growth cycle depends on its constituent reactions. Deterministic models based on ordinary differential equations can capture essential relationships among virus constituents. However, an infection may be initiated by a single virus particle that delivers its genome, a single molecule of DNA or RNA, to its host cell. Under such conditions, a stochastic model that allows for inherent fluctuations in the levels of viral constituents may yield qualitatively different behavior. To compare modeling approaches, we developed a simple model of the intracellular kinetics of a generic virus, which could be implemented deterministically or stochastically. The model accounted for reactions that synthesized and depleted viral nucleic acids and structural proteins. Linear stability analysis of the deterministic model showed the existence of two nodes, one stable and one unstable. Individual stochastic simulation runs could access and remain at the unstable node. In addition, deterministic and averaged stochastic simulations yielded different transient kinetics and different steady-state levels of viral components, particularly for low multiplicities of infection (MOI), where few virus particles initiate the infection. Furthermore, a bimodal population distribution of viral components was observed for low MOI stochastic simulations. The existence of a low-level infected subpopulation of cells, which could act as a viral reservoir, suggested a potential mechanism of viral persistence. }},

abstract ={For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the âalphabetâ used to describe those systems.},

    abstract = {Cross-feeding is the exchange of nutrients among species of microbes. It has two potential evolutionary origins, one as an exchange of metabolic wastes or byproducts among species, the other as a form of cooperation known as reciprocal altruism. This paper explores the conditions favoring the origin of cooperative cross-feeding between two species. There is an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation, and some of the requirements for the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding follow from this prior workâspecifically the requirement that interactions be limited to small groups of individuals, such as colonies in a spatially structured environment. Evolution of cooperative cross-feeding by a species also requires that cross-feeding from the partner species already exists, so that the cooperating mutant will automatically be reciprocated for its actions. Beyond these considerations, some unintuitive dynamical constraints apply. In particular, the benefit of cooperative cross-feeding applies only in the range of intermediate cell densities. At low density, resource concentrations are too low to offset the cost of cooperation. At high density, resources shared by both species become limiting, and the two species become competitors. These considerations suggest that the evolution of cooperative cross-feeding in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation. However, the principles identified here may enable the experimental evolution of cross-feeding, as born out by a recent study.},

ABSTRACT = {Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a ''typical cell''. However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.RESULTS:In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.CONCLUSIONS:The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.

    abstract = {{In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such  â genetically coupledâ link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.}},

    abstract = {A stochastic genetic toggle switch model that consists of two identical, mutually repressive genes is built using the Gillespie algorithm with time delays as an example of a simple stochastic gene regulatory network. The stochastic kinetics of this model is investigated, and it is found that the delays for the protein productions can highly weaken the global fluctuations for the expressions of the two genes, making the two mutually repressive genes coexist for a long time. Starting from this model, we propose a practical modeling strategy for more complex gene regulatory networks. Unlike previous applications of the Gillespie algorithm to simulate specific genetic networks dynamics, this modeling strategy is proposed for an ensemble approach to study the dynamical properties of these networks. The model allows any combination of gene expression products, forming complex multimers, and each one of the multimers is assigned to a randomly chosen gene promoter site as an activator or inhibitor. In addition, each gene, although it has only one promoter site, can have multiple regulatory sites and distinct rates of translation and transcription. Also, different genes have different time delays for transcription and translation and all reaction constant rates are initially randomly chosen from a range of values. Therefore, the general strategy here proposed may be used to simulate real genetic networks.},

    abstract = {{Stochastic mechanisms can cause a group of isogenic bacteria, each subject to identical environmental conditions, to nevertheless exhibit diverse patterns of gene expression. The resulting phenotypic subpopulations will typically have distinct growth rates. This behavior has been observed in several contexts, including sugar metabolism and pili phase variation. Under fixed environmental conditions, the net growth rate of the population is maximized when all cells are of the fastest growing phenotype, so it is unclear what fitness advantage is conferred by population heterogeneity. However, unlike ideal laboratory conditions, natural environments tend to fluctuate, either periodically or randomly. Here we use a stochastic population model to show that, during growth in such fluctuating environments, a dynamically heterogenous bacterial population can sometimes achieve a higher net growth rate than a homogenous one. By using stochastic mechanisms to sample several distinct phenotypes, the bacteria are able to anticipate and take advantage of sudden changes in their environment. However, this heterogeneity is beneficial only if the bacterial response rate is sufficiently low. Our results could be useful in the design of artificial evolution experiments and in the optimization of fermentation processes. 10.1534/genetics.167.1.523}},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.}

abstract ={Fluctuations in protein numbers (noise) due to inherent stochastic effects in single cells can have large effects on the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks. Although deterministic models can predict the average network behavior, they fail to incorporate the stochasticity characteristic of gene expression, thereby limiting their relevance when single cell behaviors deviate from the population average. Recently, stochastic models have been used to predict distributions of steady-state protein levels within a population but not to predict the dynamic, presteady-state distributions. In the present work, we experimentally examine a system whose dynamics are heavily influenced by stochastic effects. We measure population distributions of protein numbers as a function of time in the Escherichia coli lactose uptake network (lac operon). We then introduce a dynamic stochastic model and show that prediction of dynamic distributions requires only a few noise parameters in addition to the rates that characterize a deterministic model. Whereas the deterministic model cannot fully capture the observed behavior, our stochastic model correctly predicts the experimental dynamics without any fit parameters. Our results provide a proof of principle for the possibility of faithfully predicting dynamic population distributions from deterministic models supplemented by a stochastic component that captures the major noise sources.},

    abstract = {{In the current era of functional genomics, it is remarkable that the intracellular range of transcript abundance is largely unknown. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, hybridization-based complexity analysis and SAGE analysis showed that the majority of yeast mRNAs are present at one or fewer copies per cell; however, neither method provides an accurate estimate of the full range of low abundance transcripts. Here we examine the range of intracellular transcript abundance in yeast using kinetically monitored, reverse transcriptase-initiated PCR (kRT-PCR). Steady-state transcript levels encoded by all 65 genes on the left arm of chromosome III and 185 transcription factor genes are quantitated. Abundant transcripts encoded by glycolytic genes, previously quantitated by kRT-PCR, are present at a few hundred copies per cell whereas genes encoding physiologically important transcription factors are expressed at levels as low as one-thousandth transcript per cell. Of the genes assessed, only the silent mating type loci, HML and HMR, are transcriptionally silent. The results show that transcript abundance in yeast varies over six orders of magnitude. Finally, kRT-PCR, cDNA microarray, and high density oligonucleotide array assays are compared for their ability to detect and quantitate the complete yeast transcriptome.}},

    abstract = {{A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of `influence' among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform `inference' by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed `marrying' and `filling-in'. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Learning dynamic Bayesian network structures provides a principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data. An important assumption of traditional DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process, an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical model called a non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. Some examples of evolving networks are transcriptional regulatory networks during an organism's development, neural pathways during learning, and traffic patterns during the day. We define the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data.}},

    abstract = {{Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient1, 2, 3. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified4, 5, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses6, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.}},

abstract ={Gillespie stochastic simulation is used extensively to investigate stochastic phenomena in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology to ecology. The inverse problem, however, has remained largely unsolved: How to reconstruct the underlying reactions de novo from sparse observations. A key challenge is that often only aggregate concentrations, proportional to the population numbers, are observable intermittently. We discovered that under specific assumptions, the set of relative population updates in phase space forms a convex polytope whose vertices are indicative of the dominant underlying reactions. We demonstrate the validity of this simple principle by reconstructing stochastic models (reaction structure plus propensities) from a variety of simulated and experimental systems, where hundreds and even thousands of reactions may be occurring in between observations. In some cases, the inferred models provide mechanistic insight. This principle can lead to the understanding of a broad range of phenomena, from molecular biology to population ecology.},
