Panel B illustrates how the average risk changes with time for the control and the positive cohorts. Note that the risk progressions are somewhat monotonic, and the computed confidence bounds suggest that the odds of a child with low risk upto 100 or 150 weeks of age abruptly shifting to a high risk trajectory is low. Panel C shows the distribution of the prediction horizon: the time to a clinical diagnosis after inferred relative risk crosses $90\%$. Panel D shows that for each new disease code for a low-risk child, ASD risk increases by approximately $2\%$ for either sex.

The two extreme operating zones marked as High Precision (HP) and High Recall (HR): if we choose to operate in HR, then we do not reduce the number of positive screens by much, but maximize sensitivity, while by operating in HP, we increase sensitivity by 20-40\% (depending on the prevalence) but double the PPV achieved in current practice. In contrast, when choosing to maximize sensitivity by operating in the HR zone, we only cut down positive flags to about $70\%$ of what we get with M-CHAT/F, but boost sensitivity by $50-90\%$ (Reaching sensitivities over $70\%$).
