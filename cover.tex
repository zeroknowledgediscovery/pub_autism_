\JNAME\\
\JADDR

Dear \BEDITOR

Please find enclosed the  revised manuscript entitled "\textbf{\TITLE}" for your consideration for publication in \JNAME as an original article. We have meticulously addressed the points raised by the reviewers, and highlighted changes in the main and Supplementary text in red.

Autism spectral disorder (ASD) is currently  screened for in toddlers using standard questionnaires, $.e.g.$ M-CHAT/F with a  high number of false positives (85\%) and  a low sensitivity (38\%) -- translating to long wait-times for confirmatory diagnosis ($\approx 1$ year). Children lose crucial time within which  interventions are the most effective.  Additionally, questionnaires are prone to interpretive biases leading to systematic under-diagnosis in diverse communities.  %Finding genetic diagnostic bio-markers have been problematic due to  the highly heterogeneous presentation of ASD.

Here we report an orthogonal methodology that requires \textbf{no questionnaires or blood-work}. Using novel  stochastic learning on individual diagnostic codes already recorded during past doctor's visits, we design  a  risk estimator significantly out-performing the state-of-the-art. Without  pre-selecting co-morbid disorders, we learn hidden patterns in medical histories to enable cutting down false positives by upto half without losing specificity.
Additionally, we get new insights into co-morbid risk that might shed light into ASD pathobiology.
%No blood work. New insights. Orthogonal methodology.

% In this study, we  use  co-morbidity patterns  to design a questionnaire-free screening tool. Using individual diagnostic codes already recorded during regular doctor's visits, we engineer a  risk estimator based on  stochastic learning algorithms. With large cohort sizes in two independent databases ($\approx 5M$ and $\approx 70K$ respectively), we demonstrate high predictive performance (AUC $> 80\%$)  from shortly after 2 years of age, and better sensitivity/specificity trade-offs compared to M-CHAT/F. Also, in combined operation with M-CHAT/F,  we achieve  a 50\%  increase in sensitivity, or a doubling of the positive predictive value, while not losing specificity.
