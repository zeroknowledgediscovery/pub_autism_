Dear \BEDITOR

Please find enclosed the  manuscript entitled "\textbf{\TITLE}" for your consideration for publication in \JNAME as a research article. 

Autism spectral disorder (ASD) is currently  screened for in toddlers using standard questionnaires, $.e.g.$ M-CHAT/F, completed by parents at doctors' visits. The M-CHAT/F produces a notoriously high number of false positives (85\%) and  a low sensitivity (38\%). This overwhelming number of false positives translates to long wait-times for confirmatory diagnosis ($\approx 1$ year). Children lose crucial time within which  interventions are the most effective.  Additionally, questionnaires are prone to interpretive biases leading to systematic under-diagnosis in diverse communities.  Finding genetic diagnostic bio-markers have been problematic due to  the highly heterogeneous presentation of ASD.

Here we report an orthogonal methodology that requires \textbf{no questionnaires and no blood-work}. Using novel approaches to stochastic learning from  individual diagnostic codes already recorded during past doctor's visits, we design  a  risk estimator significantly out-performing the state-of-the-art. WIthout manually pre-selecting co-morbid disorders, we learn hidden patterns in medical histories to enable cutting down false positives by half without losing specificity.
Additionally, we get new insights into co-morbid risk that might shed light into sex differences, and ASD pathobiology, and how we can exploit subtle footprints of complex disorders in seemingly unrelated
medical encounters.
%No blood work. New insights. Orthogonal methodology.

% In this study, we  use  co-morbidity patterns  to design a questionnaire-free screening tool. Using individual diagnostic codes already recorded during regular doctor's visits, we engineer a  risk estimator based on  stochastic learning algorithms. With large cohort sizes in two independent databases ($\approx 5M$ and $\approx 70K$ respectively), we demonstrate high predictive performance (AUC $> 80\%$)  from shortly after 2 years of age, and better sensitivity/specificity trade-offs compared to M-CHAT/F. Also, in combined operation with M-CHAT/F,  we achieve  a 50\%  increase in sensitivity, or a doubling of the positive predictive value, while not losing specificity.

We are led by a multi-disciplinary team  of machine learning experts (Chattopadhyay) and clinical practioners in pediatric developmental psychology and autism: 1) Peter J. Smith, Professor of Pediatrics and \textbf{Executive Committee Chair, American Academy of Pediatrics' Section on Developmental \& Behavioral
Pediatrics}, and 2) Prof. Michael Msall, \textbf{Section Chief of Developmental \& Behavioral Pediatrics, UChicago, and Fellow of Joseph  P. Kennedy Research Center on Intellectual \& Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, UChicago}.

We believe that  the importance  and  inter-disciplinary nature of our results, with non-trivial computational modeling,  merits consideration  for  publication in \JNAME.  We look forward to, and humbly hope for, your positive  response.

Sincerely,
